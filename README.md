# Investigate-Baseball_Dataset

In this project, I analyzed a dataset and then communicated my findings about it. I used the Python libraries NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to make my analysis easier.

After the completion of this project I now know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process. Am comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions. Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format I can use. Practiced communicating the results of my analysis. Am able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and Pandas to speed up my data analysis code. Am familiar with Pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let me access my data more conveniently. And know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing my findings.
